# Iced-Editor Example
## About
I modified it myself because [the Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcBJ7cPSALo) was not compatible with version 0.13.1.

## Dependencies
(Cargo.toml)[https://github.com/seobaeksol/iced-editor-example/blob/main/Cargo.toml]
```Cargo.toml
iced = { version="0.13.1" , features = ["debug"] }
iced_futures = "0.13.2"
rfd = "0.15.1"
tokio = { version = "1.41.1", features = ["full", "fs"] }
```
